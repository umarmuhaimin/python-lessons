# ⚙️ Python Exceptions – Summary Notes

# 👉 1. What Are Exceptions?
# → Exceptions are errors that occur during program execution.
# → Instead of crashing, Python lets you “handle” these errors gracefully.
# → Example of a runtime error (exception):
# • print(10 / 0)  # ZeroDivisionError

# 👉 2. Common Built-in Exceptions
# → Exception Type: Description
# • ZeroDivisionError: Dividing by zero.
# • ValueError: Wrong data type (e.g., int("abc")).
# • TypeError: Using an invalid operation on incompatible types.
# • NameError: Using a variable that doesn’t exist.
# • IndexError: Accessing an invalid index in a list.
# • KeyError: Accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary.
# • FileNotFoundError: Opening a file that doesn’t exist.

# 👉 3. Using try and except
# → Used to handle errors and prevent program crashes.
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(10 / x)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")

# 👉 4. Optional Blocks
# → else: Runs only if no error occurs.
# → finally: Runs no matter what (used for cleanup actions like closing files).

try:
    f = open("file.txt")
    print("File opened successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
else:
    print("No error occurred.")
finally:
    f.close()
    print("File closed.")

# 👉 5. Raising Exceptions Manually
# → Use raise to create your own error intentionally.
raise ValueError("Invalid input! Please try again.")

# 👉 6. Handling Multiple Exceptions
# → You can catch multiple exceptions in one block:
# try:
#     # some code
# except (TypeError, ValueError):
#     print("Something went wrong.")

# 👉 7. Why Exception Handling Is Important
# → Prevents program crashes.
# → Makes your code more reliable and user-friendly.
# → Helps you debug and handle unexpected behavior.

# 👉 8. Best Practices
# → Only catch exceptions you can handle.
# → Keep try blocks small and specific.
# → Use clear error messages for debugging.
