### In this python file, we will define a function that calculates the square of a number.

# Square Integers : 
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    print("x squared is", square(x))
def square(n):
    return n * n
main()

# Explaination:
# 1. We define a function named `main` that prompts the user to input an integer.
# 2. The input is converted to an integer using `int()`.
# 3. We then call another function named `square`, passing the input integer as an argument.
# 4. The `square` function takes a number `n` and returns its square by multiplying `n` by itself.
# 5. Finally, the result is printed in the `main` function.
# 6. The `main` function is called to execute the program.


# Cubic Integers :
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    print("x cubic is", cubic(x))
def cubic(n):
    return n * n * n
main()

# To the power of n calculations :
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    print("x to the power of n is", power(x)) # where n is an integer defined by user.
def power(n): # if n = 4, then we set the program to return n ** 4.
    return n ** 4
main()

# alternative method using pow() function :
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    print("x to the power of n is", power(x)) # where n is an integer defined by user.
def power(n):   # if n = 3, then we set the program to pow(n, 3).
    return pow(n, 3)
main()

# To the power of n calculations (Second method) :
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? ")) # where x is the base defined by user.
    y = int(input("What's y? ")) # where y is the power defined by user.
    print(f"x to the power of y is {power(x, y)}")
def power(n, m):    # if n = base and m = power, then we set the program to return n ** m.
    return n ** m
main()

### Just a reminder, everytime you use f-strings method, always include curly braces {}. ###

# alternative method without f-string :
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? ")) # where x is the base defined by user.
    y = int(input("What's y? ")) # where y is the power defined by user.
    print("x to the power of y is", power(x, y))
def power(n, m):    # if n = base and m = power, then we set the program to return n ** m.
    return n ** m
main()

# We put main() at the end of the code to tell Python to start running the program from the main function ; start running the program from the beginning of the code " def main(): function".
# When Python reads your file, it defines all functions first. By calling main() at the end, you tell Python to actually execute the code inside main. Without this call, nothing would happenâ€”the functions would just be defined but never used.
# This is a common practice to organize code and make it clear where the program starts.
# Without main(), this program of codes will not run perfectly.
# main() at the end of the code is basically a prompt to call the function that you have made in order run it successfully.


# To create a function in Python :

# 1. Use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.
# 2. Inside the parentheses, you can define parameters that the function will take.
# 3. Use a colon `:` to indicate the start of the function body.
# 4. Indent the function body to indicate that it belongs to the function.
# 5. Use the `return` statement to return a value from the function.

# Simplest way to create your own function :

# 1. def main ()
# 2. Introduce condition with function
# 3. Give definition to function
# 4. main()
