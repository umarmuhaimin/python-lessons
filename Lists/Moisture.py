# ğŸ”¹ Target of this project:

# â†’ To monitor soil moisture levels.
# â†’ To keep checking moisture until it is low enough (20% or less).
# â†’ To notify you when itâ€™s time to water the soil.

# ğŸ‘‰ Calls a function called sample() to get the current moisture level.
# â†’ Prints the moisture level as a percentage.
# â†’ While the moisture is above 20%, keeps checking the moisture by calling sample() again and printing the new value.
# â†’ When the moisture drops to 20% or below, prints "It's time to water" and stops.

# ğŸ‘‰ The addition of days variable is to track how many days have passed while checking the moisture.
# â†’ days += 1 is to increase the day count starting from day = 0 to present day.

# ğŸ”¹ Summary of the changes:
# â†’ We add a day counter.
# â†’ Prints the day and moisture level at the start.
# â†’ Intended to update the day count each time the loop runs.
