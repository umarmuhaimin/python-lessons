# ðŸ”¹ Explaination line by line 

# ðŸ‘‰ if guess == "GRAPHIC": WORDS.clear()
# â†’ This means:
# â€¢ If the player types "GRAPHIC", the program removes all words from the dictionary using .clear().
# â€¢ This ends the game immediately, because while len(WORDS) > 0: will now be false.
# â†’ Summary:
# â€¢ Typing "GRAPHIC" clears the dictionary and wins the game.
