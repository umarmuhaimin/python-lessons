# ðŸ”¹ Purpose of this file:

# â†’ To show all the words in the dictionary and how many points each word is worth.
# â†’ Itâ€™s not a game, just a way to display the contents of the WORDS dictionary.

# ðŸ‘‰ What are we trying to achieve?
# â†’ Print each word and its points, so you can see what words are available and their scores.

# ðŸ‘‰ What is the use of .items()?
# â†’ .items() lets you loop through both the key (word) and value (points) in the dictionary at the same time.
# â†’ Example:
# â†’ For WORDS = {"PAIR": 4, "HAIR": 4},
# â†’ .items() gives you pairs like ("PAIR", 4) and ("HAIR", 4) printed/outputed all at the same time.

# ðŸ‘‰ In short:
# â†’ .items() helps you get both the word and its points to print them together all at the same time.
# â†’ .items() allows us to output all of the keys_and_values from the dictionary all at the same time, so you can print them together in a loop.
