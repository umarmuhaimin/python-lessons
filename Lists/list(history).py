# ðŸ”¹ Target of this project:

# â†’ To keep track of a list of actions (History).
# â†’ To let you undo the last action or restart (clear) all actions.
# â†’ Itâ€™s a simple way to learn how to use lists, .append(), .pop(), and .clear() in Python.

# ðŸ‘‰ Starts with an empty list called history.
# â†’ Keeps asking the user for an action.
# â†’ If you type something (like "Jump" or "Run"), it adds that action to the history list and prints the list.
# â†’ If you type "Undo", it removes the last action from the list and tells you what was undone.
# â†’ If you type "Restart", it clears all actions from the list.
# â†’ The loop keeps going forever (until you stop the program) by inputing Exit where it will break the loop.
